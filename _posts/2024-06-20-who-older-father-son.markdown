## Here we go again
It was a cold night, it was a warm night. He thought that he will not have to buy any new diapers again. He will not lament any waisted diapers either. His little toodler has now finished the potty training and now it's the annoying night routine of going to the bathroom every couple of hours. He was ready for that but he wasn't ready for the new bun in the oven.

He thought he knew everything he was about to face; raising a new born is not an easy task, but at least he has some experience now. What he didn't know was that with new baby he must be a new dad. A father of the first child is not the same as a father of two children. On one hand, no two babies are identical, even identical twins. On the other hand, dedicating his time to one child is drastically different from spliting his parenthood time between two children.

## Who is older?
Here comes an answer I didn't expect for a question I never bondered; if we have a father and a son, who will be older? In terms of age, one might conclude that the father is much older, as we normally observe that humans are born very dependent on their parents and need a good amount of time before they can be fully developed and ready to take the responsibility of reproduction.

But upon careful pondering, the father is only a father once he gets a son. And without ever having this child, we would't call him the father of that child. So in such prespective, the father starts to be a father once there is a child.

But one might say, surely this case is not applicable for the subsequent children! But dear, the father of one child is drastically different than the father of two.
